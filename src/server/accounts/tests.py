# Create your tests here.
# Do not bother testing Django built in User and Group models, they work and do not need coverage.
# for examples of testing and TDD with Django, see this guide I made here: https://github.com/utsprogsoc/testdrivendevelopment
# Only test models that you custom design, or extensions/proxies of existing models.
# Views and url patterns can also be tested here.
