====================================

*(Negating Overspending and Waste via Algorithms Searching Tasty Easy Recipes)* 
UTS Data Systems Spring Session 2020

Are you sick and tired of rummaging through your fridge to see what you need? Do you need a quick and easy system to tell you which items are about to expire and give you reminders to head to the grocery store? 

`NO WASTE`_ will provide you with a solution and additionally allow you to track your carbon footprint from food wastes to encourage sustainable living and provide you with personalised recipes based on your personal information. 
 
Users can create an account and then log in to the website. Once they are logged in, they can  search different items in order to find the best recipes given the ingredients which are stored in the users fridge. The search tool offers to the user the best and healthiest recipes and the food information (protein, calories ect.) that goes with it. Users are free to share recipes with friends and compete to have the highest leaderboard score which is given based on CO2 emissions, Recipes chosen and Recipes used to make food. Should a food item, such as milk be close to expiry then it will provide a notification to the user informing them.
